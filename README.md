### Hello!
##### I am Ritali Ghosh, a graduate student working with Prof. Prateek Sharma at the *Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore*. I am a computational astrophysicist working on idealized simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. Specifically, I study the *circumgalactic medium* (CGM) -- the diffuse, extended reservoir of plasma that permeates the space beyond the galaxy's disk and extends far up to its virial radius. The CGM regulates the gas flow into and out of a galaxy's disk, and understanding its evolution is a key to understanding the ever-evolving nature of galaxies â€“ star formation, supernovae, and the interplay of the baryons and dark matter that grow and transform over cosmic timescales.

### About me
I joined the Joint Astronomy and Astrophysics Program at the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science in 2019. Prior to this, I earned my Master's degree (M.Sc. Physics) from the *University of Calcutta*, having completed my Bachelor's (B.Sc. Physics) from the esteemed *Bethune College*. Born in the vibrant city of Nashik in Maharashtra, I had the opportunity to experience life across various corners of India as my family moved across cities before eventually settling in the *city of joy*, Kolkata, in West Bengal. From childhood, I have inculcated a profound appreciation for the diverse cultures across India, as well as a passion for exploring new places and traveling. In my spare time, you would find me immersed in a canvas or, sometimes, cooking a warm meal with my friends and family.
